# Problem Definiton and Objectives

## The Problem

### Problem Analysis
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
This project follows a Design Thinking approach thus the part where research on problem was done using tools outlined in "Empathy" stage of the common Design Thinking Pattern defined by Hasso Platner Institute of Design at Stanford (n.d.) Thus, a collection of interviews was conducted with all stakeholders of interest namely, Inbound Call Customers, Outbound Call Customers and Relationship Managers. The results of these interviews were represented in an Empathy Map format. Although some of the points identified in these interviews and Empathy Maps were directly related with The Call Centre, some of them had broader perspective including topics such as products offered, company operations, competitor offers and so forth. The scope of this analysis and work however will be concentrated on The Call Centre thus the problems identified with broader perspective will be tried to analyzed and solved by a Call Centre perspective.       

The analysis of The Empathy Maps for Inbound Call Customers and thereby interviews yield some of the most common problems and their causations amongst this customer group. A major issue identified was customers not getting the answers they are seeking prior to call. The reason for this, as identified by customers, was RMs they were speaking to sometimes being uninformed about the products customers asking about. Another issue was dealing with answering machine. Majority of Inbound Callers indicated they are not pleased when an answering machine is connected to the call. Current answering machine (Automated Call Distributor) was noted to have a complicated menu, the default information given by Automated Call Distributor usually being not sufficient for customers' queries and it was also stated that it took a lot of time to actually connect to an RM partly because of complicated menu and also long waiting times. Many of the inbound callers were observed to be much more willing to purchase holiday packages such that they have indicated behavior such as dreaming about holidays, saving money for travelling and so forth as visible in Empathy Maps 1 and 2. Therefore these type of customers should be prioritized and be able to reach a better customer service when they call The Call Centre.

Outbound Call Customers' Empathy Maps revealed some other key information and problems that this group is experiencing. Some of the common and generic problems identified were untimely calls, too insistent RMs, receiving too many sales calls, being called from an unknown number and so forth. One of key issues identified however was RMs sometimes offering unviable holiday packages to customers. For example, it was identified that extra luxury travel packages was offered to middle/low income group, or another example was holiday packages considered inappropriate by social group of the customer offered in outbound calls. As depicted in Empathy Maps, such cases were observed to be leading to customer dislike towards the company. This was thought be caused by RMs being uninformed about the customer's social and economic disposition. Furthermore, even if the holiday package offered was not inappropriate, numerous customers indicated that majority of the holiday packages offered was not interesting to them thus they view most of the sales calls as a waste of time. This again was thought to be RM's lack of information about the customer prior to call.

Relationship Managers' Empathy Maps were particularly insightful about the current system. RMs have expressed that their main fear was their skills score decreasing as a result of unsuccessful sales. They have stated that one of the main contributors to such result was being uninformed about the customer. They indicated that they feel like they are losing the grip of conversation when they don't say something relatable to customer during an outbound call, thus when uninformed about customer, saying such thing was dependent of chance and basic intuition about the customer. Furthermore, it was also found that, in such cases where the RM is not able to attract the attention of the customer right away, the call time was increasing since RMs were trying to offer different packages until they can attract the attention of the customer resulting in larger phone bills for the company. It was also identified that RMs were sometimes having difficulties during inbound calls due to lack of information on the details of some of the products. As visible, RMs' major problems are complimentary to inbound and outbound call customers' major problems.

On a final note, the main problems identified were inbound call customers not being able to reach desired information about the products they are curious about on some occasions, outbound call customers not being interested in the products offered and RMs being anxious about their speeches either due to not being well-informed about the customer or not being well-informed about the holiday packages. Therefore, the common theme of all these problems is identified as the lack of information and thereby operations based on pre-acquired information about customers and RMs.

### Problem Definition

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Current system routs RMs to customers without taking information about RM and customer into consideration thus ultimately causing loss of potential customer base by causing some sale speeches to be uninteresting and sometimes outright repellent for the customer.
