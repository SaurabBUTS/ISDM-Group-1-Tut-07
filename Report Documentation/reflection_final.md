## Relationship Manager

#### Problems Identified 

RM’s are responsible for handling sales calls and service enquiries. RM’s are given a skill score based on the duration of previous calls and their profile. RM’s are primarily concerned with their skill score decreasing due to an inability to capture a customer’s attention, being uniformed about customer profiles, the inability to generate a sale and long phone call durations. RM’s also identified difficulties during calls due to poor product knowledge.

#### Parameters for Improvement 

*	Improve call routing speed
*	Generate accurate Customer Profiles
*	Generate accurate RM Profiles
*	Improve RM and Customer Matching
*	Improve RM product knowledge

#### Ideas to meet the parameters  

*	Create a system that routes calls based on customer priority and likelihood to purchase
*	Create a system that collates data regarding outbound and inbound customers to create profiles
*	RM’s should proactively check the Automatic Call Distributor for customers that fit their profile during downtime
*	RM’s should be well informed about holiday packages and focus on selling the most compatible package to a customer
*	RM’s should be trained to know when to pursue or abandon the sales call 

## Inbound Callers

#### Problems Identified

Inbound callers are customers who contact the travel agency via the CMC. Often, inbound calls are directed to the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) unit. This process can be time consuming and frustrating for customers. Callers have identified that the IVR features a complicated menu which is difficult to navigate. The IVR does not contain sufficient information or options for callers. Finally, inbound callers have been dissatisfied with RM’s, who may be unable to address their enquiries.   

#### Parameters for Improvement

*	Create an IVR system that features a wide range of options 
*	Create an IVR system that is easy to navigate
*	Create an IVR system that routes customers based on criteria such as severity of problem (i.e. billing issue prioritised over price enquiry)
*	Increase in first-call problem resolution rates

#### Ideas to meet the parameters

*	Improve CMC scalability such that calls can be answered quickly and without interruption
*	Include call back services to improve customer service. RM’s can generate an outbound call for inbound customers who are displeased with wait times. 
*	Promote call transfers to more knowledgeable RM’s to ensure issues are resolved on first contact
*	Provide customer surveys to gather feedback on calls. Feedback will enable the CMC to identify problem areas
*	RM’s should contribute to the customer score allocation process by scoring customers based on parameters such as high budget. This may provide the opportunity for RM’s to prioritise customers with a higher budget. Though, bias, and unfair prioritisation must be considered 

## Outbound Callers

#### Problems Identified

Outbound call customers are customers that receive calls from RM’s. Outbound customers have reported that they receive untimely calls and are unwilling to pick up calls from an unknown number. Outbound customers may not want to hear about holiday packages or are recommended packages that are not viable for their budget and lifestyle. As a result, many customers have suggested that such calls are a waste of their time.

#### Parameters for Improvement

*	Improved customer satisfaction
*	Increase in outbound sales due to proper customer profiling and RM matching
*	Increase in the number of answered calls on first contact

#### Ideas to meet the parameters

*	Create an automatic dialler that recognises the time of calls and adjusts call times based on customer profiles
*	Promote call back services that allow outbound customers to contact the CMC and specific RM when they are interested or have time to speak
*	Create a system that recognises the socioeconomic status of outbound call customers so that the best possible package can be offered
