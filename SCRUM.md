# SCRUM

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The creators of Scrum Methodology define The Scrum as "A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value." (Schwaber & Sutherland 2017). The following part of the project will briefly explain the key elements of The Scrum Methodology and then it will evaluate how each of these tools and guidelines were utilised and benefitted in this project. 
</div>

## User Stories

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
User stories are high level product features that are written from different stakeholders' perspectives. Also known as "Point of View Statements", it is important to note that User Stories usually aim to catch user perspective functionality (aka. High Level functionality) rather than technical details of the functionality. They commonly consist of single sentence that follows a predefined structure. This structure is as follows:
</div> 

*"As a [persona], I [want to], [so that]."* (Rehkopf M. n.d.)

<div style="text-align: justify">    
The purpose of user stories is to encourage developers to empathize with stakeholders that will be affected by the system they are developing. Hence it is assumed that if they can empathize with the stakeholders, the system will better respond to the needs and wants of stakeholders. A 2016 study researching the effectiveness of User Stories conducted by academics in Utrecht University stated that "The simple structure of user stories enables developing the right software, for it facilitates creating a common understanding concerning the requirement." (Lucassen G. et. al. 2016) as one of the reasons why User Stories are widely used and accepted as beneficial by many. Collectively, User Stories create another key element of the Scrum process called <i>The Product Backlog</i> which will be explained below.  
</p>
The group utilised User Stories to empathise and try to relate to the imagined stakeholders in the problem statement shared. They were used to ideate solutions to the problems identified in Empathy stage without moving away from a user perspective. Moreover, they were also beneficial for representing all the functionality that the group needs to design in an organized and user centred way.
</div>

## Product Backlog

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The Product Backlog is commonly the collection of all user stories. However, a considerable amount of implementations of Scrum in practice also uses this tool to register basic task statements not written from a user perspective (unlike a user story) as well. This tool should be though as a board for the whole team to keep track of the functionalities that got implemented and functionalities waiting to be implemented. Traditionally, The Product Owner shapes and manages The Product Backlog with the help of The Scrum Master (more on these roles later). According to Schwaber & Sutherland (2017), a Product Backlog is never complete. It gets updated and edited continuously throughout the product life-cycle as new feedback from stakeholders arrive. This idea of constant improvement of The Product Backlog makes it one of the central features of the Scrum by introducing a starkly Agile element into the picture.     
</div>
</p>
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The group benefitted from a Product Backlog by using it as tool for organizing its user stories. It was particularly useful in having an idea for what the final product will look like after all the functionalities are complete thus seeing the big picture. It was also useful tool for Sprint Planning purposes where the group estimated an average time of implementation for each user story thus estimating an average time of completion for each Sprint. Hence, Product Backlog was an important tool for time management as well. 
</div>


## Sprints

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The Agile Alliance (n.d.) defines a Sprint as "a timebox of one month or less during which the team produces a potentially shippable product Increment." Sprints are short development events where a subset of The User Stories are implemented by the team. These User Stories are represented in a board called The Sprint Backlog (more on this later) and as mentioned the ultimate aim of every Sprint is to create an increment of the final product that is usable as it is. This aim of Sprints is another point that gives strong agility to Scrum Methodology since such configuration enables early testing and continuous improvement during the development process. Traditionally, Sprints start with a team meeting called The Sprint Planning where the team discusses the contents of the Sprint Backlog. A Sprint ends with a Sprint Review and a Sprint Retrospective following The Review. A Sprint Review is a meeting with all the team, including the stakeholders, where product achieved at the end of Sprint is presented to The Product Owner and the stakeholders. Whereas a Sprint Retrospective is a meeting where the team does the critique of the Sprint. This will be explained in more detail below.
</div>
</p>
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The group utilised Sprints by dividing the User Stories created between 3 different Sprints. Working in Sprints also enabled the group to conduct regular meetings and keeping each other updated of the individual process of each member. Lastly, they were another useful tool for the time management of the group since they collectively enabled a time estimation for the whole product.
</div>

## Sprint Backlogs

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Sprint Backlogs are a subset of The Product Backlog where User Stories that are to be implemented in a particular Sprint are collected and listed. The team, including the developers, modify the Sprint Backlog during a Sprint. It ideally should be adjusted in way that all the User Stories included in The Sprint Backlog should result in a shippable increment of the product. 
</div>
</p>
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The group utilised Sprint Backlogs when dividing the User Stories to be implemented in different Sprints. They enabled an incremental look for the product where the group could imagine different stages of the final product during development.
</div>

## SCRUM Roles
Scrum Methodology has different, predefined roles under its umbrella. Most commonly accepted version of these roles is the following.

### Product Owner
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The Product Owner is a single person that clarifies what issues final product should solve and address. Therefore, they are the person who singularly manages and edits The Product Backlog. Of course ideally changes to Product Backlog should be made by consulting to The Scrum Master and even to The Development Team yet nonetheless The Product Owner has the authority to change The Product Backlog as they see it appropriate. Schwaber & Sutherland (2017) defines the main responsibility of The Product Owner as "maximizing the value of the product resulting from work of the Development Team."  
</p>
The group accepted The Product Owner as its Tutor, Juan Castilla Rho. The changes to the final product and Sprint Plannings were discussed with him. However, unlike traditional Scrum practices, he wasn't first-hand managing The Product Backlog. Rather, the group was collectively doing this. 
</div>

### SCRUM Master
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The Scrum Master is defined as "the team role responsible for ensuring the team lives agile values and principles and follows the processes and practices that the team agreed they would use." (The Agile Alliance n.d.) Thus, like The Product owner, The Scrum Master is a singular person who's purpose is to lead The Development Team using Scrum practices and act as a bridge between them and The Product Owner and stakeholders.  
</p>
The group didn't assign a Scrum Master rather this responsibility was divided equally amongst the member. However, it should be noted that this was only due to The Project being imaginary and relatively small scale. It is a better practice to assign a Scrum Master and it is definitely recommended for future reference.
</div>

### Development Team Member
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The Development Team is the team that conducts the all the technical development process. Therefore, a Development Team Member can have different development related roles such as programmer, systems architect, business analyst, tester and so forth. Unlike traditional methodologies, Scrum expects a high degree of self-organization and management from The Development Team. Thus, effectively encouraging The Development Team to adjust to each other and display team work.
</p>
All of the group members were considered to be a part of the development team. Although there weren't areas assigned to each member according to their expertise, all members had different parts of the project they needed to deliver. This was configured as such because the imagined project is never intended to go to real development stage. Hence, all of the group members were a part of the design process.
</div>

## Daily SCRUM
<div style="text-align: justify">
Daily Scrums are short (usually no longer than 15 minutes), meetings that are done at the beginning of each development day, hence commonly during Sprints. The purpose of these meetings is to update the rest of the team on a member's individual process. Hence elements such as obstacles experienced between last Daily Scrum and now, newly identified issues or ideas and so forth. Commonly, in each Daily Scrum, each team member has a certain set of questions that they need to answer. An example given for these questions in The Scrum Guide by Schwaber & Sutherland (2017) is as follows:
<i>
</p>
</br> What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal? 
</br>What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?</br>Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal? 
</i>
</p>
The group didn't have daily meetings, but meetings were conducted twice every week. They enabled the group to be updated about the individual process, improvement and obstacles faced vy team members. 
</div>

## Sprint Retrospective
<div style="text-align: justify">
The Sprint Retrospective is defined as the retrospective meeting that discusses how thing went during previous sprint and identifies possible adjustments for the next Sprint (Agile Alliance n.d.) As suggested,The Sprint Retrospective is the activity that marks the end of each Sprint. It is particularly useful on getting the team thinking about the not just the improvement of the product, but the improvement of the producers (aka. The Scrum Team). Therefore, it is highly beneficial for a team that aims self-improvement.
</p>
The group didn't do traditional Sprint Retrospectives. This was done on an online messaging platform where individual members reflected upon their process at the end of each Sprint. Thus, in a way, the group's sprint retrospectives were documented and accessible to all team members at any given time.
