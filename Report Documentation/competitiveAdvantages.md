# Competitive Advantages

### 1. Customer Satisfaction

  a) **Skills-based Routing**

The CMC IS implements a skills-based routing system for inbound calls that matches the RM’s with customers based on their previous call history, profile and skill score. Accordingly, the CMC can expect an increase in first-call resolution rates as the most appropriate RM will be matched with customers to ensure service enquiries are resolved quickly. If service enquiries are resolved on first contact, there will be an increase in the number of sales opportunities for the CMC, as RM’s are able to efficiently allocate their time to sales calls and enquiries. Outbound calls are assigned to RM’s via a customer target list that matches the customer’s profile with an RM. RM’s are provided a system-generated sales pitch that matches the customer’s profile. Resultantly, RM’s can provide a personalised and rewarding experience for customers, thereby improving customer relations and sales conversion rates. 

  b) **Call Volume Management**

The CMC’s Interactive Voice Response (IVR) System will significantly improve load management during busy periods. Customers will be redirected to the most suitable RM who are already privy to their customer profile and enquiry details. The IVR system ensures that customers feel that their enquiries are treated with care and provides a timeline for resolution, resulting in a higher quality customer experience.  

### 2. Highly Skilled Labour

  a) **Measuring Performance**

The IS provides the CMC management team with information regarding RM performance based on previous calls, sales conversions and problem resolution rates. Management will be able to determine how their RM’s follow company policies and procedures and how their RM’s are performing against KPI measures. 

  b) **Training and Development**

The performance measures output by the IS provides management with training and development opportunities for their RM’s. Management will be able to identify problem areas and challenging scenarios that impact an RM’s sales and service performance. Management will be able to develop a training plan to improve RM performance so that the customer experience is enhanced and sales goals are met.     

### 3. Cost Savings

The IS offers an opportunity to improve the productivity and efficiency of the RM’s. The CMC will witness a more efficient use of time and more productive allocation of resources to income generating activities, such as sales calls. An improvement in the quality of service provided by RM’s is likely to have the residual impact of attracting more customers to the travel agency due to high customer satisfaction and approval ratings. 

### 4. Enhanced Reporting and Analytics

The travel agency can derive meaningful business insights from the IS. The IS will inform management about the number of calls, average call and wait times, average speed of answer and customer churn rates. Management will be able to easily identify problem areas, rectify issues and undergo process improvement. 

# Risks posed by Project Failure

### 1. Financial Loss

A failure to deliver an effective IS solution may lead to financial losses for the travel agency. The travel agency would have raised capital and allocated project costs for the IS solution. If the system were to fail, the company would not reap the competitive benefits of the system and will suffer a financial loss. Such a loss may result in negative performance reviews, pay cuts and potentially job loss.

### 2. Reputational Risk

The IS developers may face a loss in reputation due to their inability to deliver the solution on time, within budget and as per client specifications. Consequently, the developers may face a reduction in clients and new project opportunities.
