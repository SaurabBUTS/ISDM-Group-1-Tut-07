### Who are we Empathising with?

   * Customers who will be calling to get-to-know about or purchase the travel packages.
   * The role of the Inbound callers are the customers, whom we have to serve and respond to their queries and collaborate with, on calls.
   * Customers will be dialing a number which will reach the call management centre (CMC), which will then be recived by a Relationship Manager (RM) and the phone call will be done privately.
   * However, if there is a long waiting time, the call will be directed to an Automated Call Distributor and then the first available RM will be receiving.
  
 ### What do they need to DO?
 
   * Customers need to know the details about which travel package they are interested to purchase in during the phone call session.
   * Customers also have to let the RMs know about their budget they are willing to spend.
   * Customers need to inform the RMs about how many nights, location of holiday, what type of package, for example, adventurous or luxurious, hotels or resorts, they prefer.
   * Customers also have to give their personal details to the RMs so that their details could to stored safely on the company database.
   * Customers also need to compare and research if using travel agency will be cheaper or planning their own holiday.
