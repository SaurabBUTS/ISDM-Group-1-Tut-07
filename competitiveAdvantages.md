# Competitive Advantages

###  Call Management Centre Optimisation 
1.  **Relationship Manager Performance**

The CMC Information System (IS) will enable management to monitor RM performance. The Skill Score and Profiler Tool system will track RM interactions and provide feedback to RM’s based on the duration and results of their calls, both inbound and outbound. Moreover, the IS provides for training and development opportunities for RM’s. The recordings and scores will provide management with a holistic view of their RM’s. They will be able to supervise key parameters which will assist in training new staff and developing existing staff.

2. 	**Customer Satisfaction**

The implementation of a skills-based routing system that matches RM’s with potential customers and inbound callers will result in greater customer satisfaction. For outbound calls, the creation of a target list for RM’s based on their skills and profile will maximise the likelihood of customers purchasing a holiday package. The IS will produce a sales script that will serve as a guideline during calls, resulting in higher sales. Inbound calls will be similarly routed to the most appropriate RM, with the goal of resolving service enquiries on first contact.    

3. 	**Call Volume Management** 

The use of an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) self-serve system will significantly improve call volume management during busy periods. Customers will be redirected via an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD) that will connect callers to an available RM. Moreover, customers will be connected to the appropriate RM, whose profile and skill score matches closely to the inbound caller’s score. As such, there will be an increase in first-call resolution rates, thereby reducing the number of repeat callers for service enquiries. This will increase the number of sales opportunities for RM’s. 

### Customer Interaction Analytics
The IS will provide skill scores and profiles to assess the agency’s customer base. This information, combined with the audio recordings of each call, will allow management to derive deep business insights. Insights will include customer churn rate, number of service enquiries, number of sales opportunities, most purchased product, and least purchased product. This will enable management to adjust their product offering according to the data collected.

### Reduced Operational Costs
An improvement in productivity and efficiency will have the effect of reducing the CMC’s operational costs as RM’s will be able to increase the number of interactions per hour, resulting in more sales opportunities and sales conversions. Moreover, the implementation of the CMC IS will inform budgetary decision making as a fixed cost will be required to maintain the IS.

# Risks if the IS fails
### Financial Loss
The largest risk of the IS failing is the financial loss that will be bore by the travel agency. The financial loss will have several impacts on the company’s outlook over the following financial year. This loss may result in job-loss or pay reduction to compensate. 

### Negative Reputation
If the IS fails, our company will be perceived in a negative light. The failure to deliver the IS project is likely to result in a reduction in the number of clients that will approach us for similar solutions.
