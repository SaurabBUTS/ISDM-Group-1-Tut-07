    provide me with efficient and effective service.

    up based off of their profile so that the RM’s are more convincing
    and have an increased chance of making a sale.

    initialised at hiring so that there are no customers being directed
    to an RM that doesn’t have the knowledge required to assist them.

    to the RM’s when making targeted outbound calls so that an improved
    service is provided to the end-customer.

    score based off of their previous call duration and their profile so
    that we know who the best RM’s are when deciding which potential

-   As a Major Travel Company I want the customers who are most likely
    to buy a product to be prioritised when being connected to an RM so
    that there is a higher likelihood of a potential sale being made.
-   As a Major Travel Company I want customers that call during a busy
    period to be directed to an Interactive Voice Response unit that
    prompts them with options so that there is a higher chance they will
    stay on the line until an RM is able to serve them.
